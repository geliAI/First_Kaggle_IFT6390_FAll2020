## Decscription
The code is developed based on the Naive Bayes method with the Multinomial distribution. Key parameters are `max_df`, the upper limit of term document frequency, and $\alpha$, the smoothing factor used when calculateing the Multinomial probability. With `max_df` = 1.0 and $\alpha$ =0.5, the code achieves an accuracy of 79.8% in the final testing phase.
